# Task-6-Online-Sales--SQL
This task analyzes the monthly sales trend by calculating total revenue and number of orders each month. It uses SQL functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and EXTRACT() to group the data by year and month. The result helps us understand how sales change over time.

###  Objective
Analyze **monthly revenue** and **order volume** using SQL aggregation.

###  Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- Kaggle

## Datasets
- **orders**: order_id, order_date, customer_name, state, city
- **details**: order_id, amount, profit, quantity, category, sub_category, payment_method

## Relationships
- Both tables are joined using `order_id`.

## Create Database
```sql
create database Online_Sales;
```
## Tables Creation
1. Details
   
```sql
create table details 
(
order_id text,
amount int,
profit int,
quantity int,
category text,
sub_category text,
payment_mode text
);
```

2. Orders
```sql
create table orders
(
order_id text,
order_date date,
customer_name text,
state text,
city text
);
```

## Copy Data Into Tables using
```sql
copy details
from 'D:\\Internship\\sql\\Online Sales\\Details.csv'
delimiter ','
csv header;
```
```sql
copy orders
from 'D:\\Internship\\sql\\Online Sales\\Orders.csv'
delimiter ','
csv header;
```

## SQL Queries


1. Years in data
```sql
select 
extract(year from "order_date" ) as year 
from 
orders
group by year;

```


2. Year + Month Number Grouping
```sql
select 
extract(year from "order_date" ) as year,
extract(month from "order_date") as month_number
from 
orders
group by year, month_number
order by month_number;

```


3. Year + Month Name

```sql
select 
extract(year from "order_date" ) as year,
extract(month from "order_date") as month_number,
to_char(order_date, 'Month') as month
from 
orders
group by year, month_number, month
order by month_number;

```

4. Monthly Revenue
```sql
select 
extract(year from o.order_date ) as year,
extract(month from o.order_date) as month_number,
to_char(order_date, 'Month') as month,
sum(d.amount) as total_revenue
from 
orders o
join details d 
on o.order_id=d.order_id
group by year, month_number, month
order by month_number;

```

5. Monthly Revenue + Total Customers
```sql
select 
extract(year from o.order_date ) as year,
extract(month from o.order_date) as month_number,
to_char(order_date, 'Month') as month,
sum(d.amount) as total_revenue,
count(distinct o.order_id) as total_customers
from 
orders o
join details d 
on o.order_id=d.order_id
group by year, month_number, month
order by month_number;


```

6. Top 3 revenue months
```sql
select 
to_char(order_date, 'FMMonth') as month,
sum(amount) as total_revenue
from 
orders o
join details d 
on o.order_id=d.order_id
group by month
order by total_revenue desc
limit 3; 

```

7. Month with Highest Average Spending Per Customer
```sql
select 
extract(month from o.order_date) as month_number,
to_char(o.order_date,'FMMonth') as month,
round((sum(amount)::numeric/count(distinct o.customer_name)),2) as avg_spending
from
orders o
join details d 
on o.order_id=d.order_id
group by month_number,month
order by avg_spending desc;

```

8. City-wise sales
```sql
select 
o.city,
sum(d.amount) as total_revenue
from
orders o
join details d 
on o.order_id=d.order_id
group by city
order by total_revenue desc;

```

9. Payment mode analysis
```sql
select
d.payment_mode,
count(distinct o.order_id) as total_orders,
sum(d.amount) as total_revenue
from
orders o
join details d 
on o.order_id=d.order_id
group by d.payment_mode
order by total_revenue desc;

```

10. Categories by profit
```sql
select
category,
sum(amount) as total_revenue,
sum(profit) as total_profit
from details
group by category
order by total_profit desc;

```

11. Sub-category sales by quantity
```sql
select
sub_category,
sum(quantity) as total_quantity,
sum(profit) as total_profit
from
details
group by sub_category
order by total_quantity desc;

```
